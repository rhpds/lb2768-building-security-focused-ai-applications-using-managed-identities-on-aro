= Deploying the application via GitOps
include::_attributes.adoc[]

- Let's find the Route of the {argocd} instance by running the following command in the Terminal:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
echo "   {argocd} UI : https://$(oc get route argocd-server -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "

- You should obtain something like this:

- You can now connect to the ArgoCD UI using your given credentials ({user}/{password}).

== Deploy the application(s) via GitOps

Now that {argocd} is deployed in your namespace, we can use it to deploy the application via GitOps.

- Copy the content of the following text, and paste it in the {ocp-short} Terminal to deploy the application.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text, subs="attributes+"]
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: claim-insurance-app
spec:
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: {user}
  project: default
  source:
    path: lab-materials/05/app
    repoURL: https://github.com/paulczar/parasol-insurance.git
    targetRevision: dev
  syncPolicy:

      prune: true
      selfHeal: false
    syncOptions: [CreateNamespace=false]

- Go to the Admin view in the {ocp-short} Console

- Make sure you have your project select: {user}
- Wait for the application to be fully deployed and initialized. It will be the case when the two Jobs `db-init-job` and `populate-images` are completed (Completions: 1 of 1).

- Once the application is deployed, you can check its Route with the following command:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
echo "   Application URL : https://$(oc get route ic-app -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "

Open the the URL in your browser to access the application and head to the next step.
